# Problem {#id1}

Construct a classifier that predicts the result of the chess game (as seen in the column _winner_) using the data from the accompanying file data.csv.

# Data info {#id2}

data.csv is a database containing data on 18 000 games played on the site _Lichess.org_. The database contains the following columns:


\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
\hline
1 & id & game identification label\\
\hline
2 & rated & whether or not the game is rated (T/F)\\
\hline
3 & created\_at & time of the beginning of the game\\
\hline
4 & last\_move\_at & end time of the game\\
\hline
5 & turns & number of total moves\\
\hline
6 & victory\_status & the way the game ended (mate/resign/outoftime/draw)\\
\hline
7 & winner & who has won (black/white)\\
\hline
8 & increment\_code & time control of the game\\
\hline
9 & white\_id & white players's username\\
\hline
10 & white\_rating & ranking of the white player\\
\hline
11 & black\_id & black player's username\\
\hline
12 & black\_ranking & ranking of the black player\\
\hline
13 & moves & list of all the moves played (in the standard chess notation)\\
\hline
14 & opening\_eco & classification of the opening\\
\hline
15 & opening\_name & the name of the opening\\
\hline
16 & opening\_ply & number of moves in the opening move\\
\hline

## Solution

Firstly, our dataframe should be imported.
By looking at the summary of our data, we are able to see that length of the column id (17 226) is smaller than number of rows in total (18 000). That means there is some duplicated data which should be cleaned.


```r
data <- read.csv("data.csv")
# calling the function summary() on our data
summary(data) 
```

```

```r
# duplicated() returns a logical vector where TRUE specifies which 
# elements of a vector or data frame are duplicates. !duplicated() means 
# that we donâ€™t want duplicate rows
data <- data[!duplicated(data$id), ]
```

To avoid introducing a bias in test using train data, the train-test split should be performed before data preparation steps. To simulate a train and test set we are going to split randomly this data set into 80% train and 20% test.


```r
# Random sample indexes
train_index <- sample(1:nrow(data), 0.8 * nrow(data))
test_index <- setdiff(1:nrow(data), train_index)

# Build data_train and data_test dataframes
data_train <- data[train_index, ]
data_test <- data[test_index, ]
```

Firstly, by looking at our dataset we can conclude that when *victory_status = "mate"* or *victory_status = "outoftime"* or *victory_status = "draw"* - the prediction can be easily made just by looking at the parity of turns, as seen in the function *predict_notResign* (since the white player always plays first). That is the reason why we've divided *data_train* into two subsets - *data_obvious*, whose predictions are going to be made in function *predict_notResign*, and *data_toAnalyze*, which we are going to analyze in the further text.
The analyses presented in the function *predict_notResign* are as following:

* *victory_status = "mate"* or *victory_status = "outoftime"* 
  + If the number of total turns is even it means that the black player made the last move: winner is *black*.
  + If the number of total turns is odd it means that the white player made the last move : winner is *white*.
* *victory_status = "draw"*
  + The winner is said to be *draw*.



```r
data_obvious <- data_train[data_train$victory_status != "resign", ]
data_toAnalyze <- data_train[data_train$victory_status == "resign", ]

predict_notResign <- function(data_obvious){
  prediction <- c()
  # we make a prediction for each observation, i.e. for each row in the data frame
  for(i in 1:nrow(data_obvious)){
    if((data_obvious[i, ]$victory_status) == "mate" || 
       (data_obvious[i, ]$victory_status) == "outoftime"){
      # if the number of turns is even - the winner is "black"
      if(data_obvious[i, ]$turns %% 2 == 0)
        prediction <- c(prediction, "black")
      else
        prediction <- c(prediction, "white")
    }
    else{ 
      # victory_status = "draw"
      # winner is "draw"
      prediction <- c(prediction, "draw")
    }
  }
  return(prediction)
}
```

The accuracy of the function *predict_obvious* can be calculated as seen bellow. As expected, it is very high. The reason why the accuracy isn't 100% is because there are observations with *victory_status = "outoftime"*, but *winner = "draw"*. We are going to ignore this for now, since the result is satisfying.


```r
prediction_notResign <- predict_notResign(data_obvious)
accuracy_notResign <- sum(prediction_notResign == 
                            data_obvious$winner)/nrow(data_obvious)
accuracy_notResign
```

```

Before using logistic regression to tackle the problem in hand, our idea is to form a number of arrays, containing some valuable information on who the winner might be. Later, we will use these arrays as predictors in logistic regression.

The following function *info* takes data frame *data* and returns arrays:


\begin{tabular}{l|l}
\hline
white\_score & score for the white player, calculated by summing the values of all the white pieces at the end of the game\\
\hline
black\_score & score for the black player, calculated by summing the values of all the black pieces at the end of the game\\
\hline
check\_black & total number of checks by the black player (in the last 10 moves)\\
\hline
check\_white & total number of checks by the white player (in the last 10 moves)\\
\hline
king\_moves\_black & total number of king moves by the black player (in the last 10 moves)\\
\hline
king\_moves\_white & total number of king moves by the white player (in the last 10 moves)\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

<table class="table" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> white_score </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> score for the white player, calculated by summing the values of all the white pieces at the end of the game </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> black_score </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> score for the black player, calculated by summing the values of all the black pieces at the end of the game </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> check_black </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> total number of checks by the black player (in the last 10 moves) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> check_white </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> total number of checks by the white player (in the last 10 moves) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> king_moves_black </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> total number of king moves by the black player (in the last 10 moves) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> king_moves_white </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> total number of king moves by the white player (in the last 10 moves) </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The score is calculated by summing all the remaining pieces values. Each piece has its own value: 


\begin{tabular}{l|l}
\hline
pawn & 1\\
\hline
knight & 3\\
\hline
bishop & 3.5\\
\hline
rook & 5\\
\hline
queen & 9\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

<table class="table" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> pawn </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> knight </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 3 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> bishop </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 3.5 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> rook </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 5 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> queen </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 9 </td>
  </tr>

The function *info* uses information on standard algebraic chess notation (Wikipedia explanation can be seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)#:~:text=Algebraic%20notation%20(or%20AN)%20is,books%2C%20magazines%2C%20and%20newspapers.)) to parse the moves and calculate the wanted arrays.
The scores should be a fair predictor, since the bigger score indicates the player's advantage in the number of pieces left on the board. Also, number of checks made in the last 10 moves by a player should be a signal of his advantage.
On the other hand, when a player moves the king in the last 10 moves, it suggests that he is "running away".

  return(data.frame(white_score,

                    check_black,

                    king_moves_black))
}
```

Let's calculate the info for our dataframes *data_toAnalyze* and *data_test*.


```r
# calculating info for data_toAnalyze
info_res <- info(data_toAnalyze)
white_score <- info_res$white_score
black_score <- info_res$black_score
check_white <- info_res$check_white
check_black <- info_res$check_black
king_moves_white <- info_res$king_moves_white
king_moves_black <- info_res$king_moves_black

# calculating info for data_test
info_res_test <- info(data_test)
white_score_test <- info_res_test$white_score
black_score_test <- info_res_test$black_score
check_white_test <- info_res_test$check_white
check_black_test <- info_res_test$check_black
king_moves_white_test <- info_res_test$king_moves_white
king_moves_black_test <- info_res_test$king_moves_black
```

Now we are able to make our logistic regression model.

Our predictors are going to be difference of rankings, difference of scores (calculated in the function *info*), parity of the turns played and difference of the checks played by the white and the black player, respectively. 
Also, the last predictor will be difference of the king moves made by black and king moves made by white. Notice that here we are subtracting white from black, while in the previous predictors it was done vice verse. The reason is because if the difference of scores (white - black) is positive it suggests that the white player is the winner. On the other hand, if the difference of the king moves (white - black) is positive it suggest that the white player "ran away" more than the black did, so the black player would be the winner.

Since we have all of the aforementioned predictors, we can model our problem on *data_toAnalyze*, and then test it on *data_test*. 


```r
# column winner has to be transformed for logistic regression
winner <- as.factor(data_toAnalyze$winner)

# predictors are being calculated on the data_toAnalyze
a <- data_toAnalyze$white_rating - data_toAnalyze$black_rating
b <- white_score - black_score
c <- data_toAnalyze$turns %% 2
d <- check_white - check_black
e <- king_moves_black - king_moves_white
model <- glm(winner ~ a + b + c + d + e, family = binomial)
# we can see that all of our predictors are significant
summary(model)
```

                      b = white_score_test - black_score_test,

                      e = king_moves_black_test - king_moves_white_test)

glm.probs <- predict(model, newdata = newdata, type = "response")

# comparing our predicted values with the actual ones

accuracy <- (accuracy_notResign * nrow(data_obvious) + 
               accuracy.glm * nrow(data_toAnalyze))/nrow(data_train)

glue("total accuracy in 1 iteration: {accuracy}")
```

```
## total accuracy in 1 iteration: 0.920646242630441
```

The last accuracy can vary depending on the partitioning done in the beginning on train-test data. Having that in mind, the idea is to repeat the same process of predicting values for 10 times and in the end define accuracy as the mean of all accuracy values.
As the function *info* is time consuming, it takes a couple of minutes for the following code to execute!


```r
